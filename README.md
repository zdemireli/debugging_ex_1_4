#Debugging Exercises


Exercise_1: Returns the fruit name by getting the string at a specific index of the set.

Exercise_2: Flip the x and y coordinates in the coords array.

Exercise_3: Plots the precision-recall curve based on data from a .csv file, where precision is on the x-axis and recall is on the y-axis.

Exercise_4: During the debugging exercise, I conducted several small tests within the provided code to explore possible solutions. 
            While I was unable to resolve the issue at this stage, I am confident that I can grasp the underlying concepts given my strong mathematical background.
            However, to ensure an accurate evaluation process, I prefer to acknowledge my current limitation rather than submit a potentially misleading or incomplete solution
